-- Table Schema:
-- Table: daily_quiz_scores
--   subject: VARCHAR
--   quiz_date: DATE
--   score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT
    subject,
    MAX(CASE WHEN quiz_date = first_date THEN score END) AS first_score,
    MAX(CASE WHEN quiz_date = last_date THEN score END) AS last_score
FROM (
    SELECT
        subject,
        quiz_date,
        score,
        MIN(quiz_date) OVER (PARTITION BY subject) AS first_date,
        MAX(quiz_date) OVER (PARTITION BY subject) AS last_date
    FROM daily_quiz_scores
) t
GROUP BY subject;
